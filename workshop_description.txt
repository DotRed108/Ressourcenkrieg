During the 20th century total war required full investment into the war from not just the military, but the entire nation. This lead to an increased strategic focus on acquiring and managing resources that supplied the home front. To expand upon this side of the war, Ressourcenkrieg adds grain and coal as resources along with stockpiling for those resources(and rubber).
