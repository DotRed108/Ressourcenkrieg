During the 20th century total war required full investment into the war from not just the military, but the entire nation. This lead to an increased strategic focus on acquiring and managing resources that supplied the home front. To expand upon this side of the war, Ressourcenkrieg adds grain and coal as resources along with stockpiling for those resources.



FEATURES

- New Resources

- Resource Stockpiling

- 16 new laws for resource management

- Factories and synthetic refineries now cost coal

- Populations now require food

- De-population mechanics due to starvation

- Toggle-able top bar resource display



GUIDE

Dockyards, military factories, and civilian factories all now cost 1 coal per day to maintain, while synthetic refineries cost 3 coal. Failure to maintain the required coal will result in significantly decreased factory output, fuel output, and rubber output. You can manage the effect of coal shortages using the resource management laws allowing you to allocate the limited coal that you have available. 

One grain feeds 1 million population. Failure to maintain enough food will result in food shortages. During a food shortage you will lose population, stability, compliance and suffer extra resistance growth. Depending on your nation's ideology you can use laws to prioritize feeding your core or occupied population. For example, in a severe food shortage if your core population is prioritized then a greater percentage of occupied pop will die than core pop and you will receive greater compliance and resistance penalties than stability penalties. 

Coal, grain, and rubber can be stockpiled. Upon entering a deficit in any of these resources, that resource will start automatically being pulled from the stockpile. The stockpile limit is determined by world tension and total infrastructure level across all states. You can also  raise one of your resourceâ€™s stockpile limit using the stockpile focus laws. 

Rationing will lower the amount of food required by your people to avoid a food shortage, but it will not reduce the severity of shortage should you find yourself in one. 


***IMPORTANT*** - The button that opens the resource stockpile window can be found at the top of the logistics tab as can be seen in picture #4 (shortcut = Shift + R)

***IMPORTANT*** - Pressing the coal and grain icons in the stockpile window will bring up a resource display on the top bar



INCOMPATABLE WITH MODS THAT CHANGE... 

- Resources

- Map Layout or any state id's



FUTURE PLANS

Further Integration with Kaserreich events and focuses that mention food and coal.
